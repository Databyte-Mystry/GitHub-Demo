# GitHub-Demo
This is the demo to be used to show how forking works!

Be sure to click the fork button towards the top right of this page. From there, this repo should be cloned and added to your own GitHub. 
From there, you'll want to clone your repo onto your personal computer. 

We're halfway there! Make your own addition to the playlist text file (please don't make any deletions, that may lead to conflicts!). After
you've done that, push your changes onto your repo and open a pull request. If everything went well, congratulations! You've contributed
to your first (and probably not your last) GitHub repository!
